### Functionality

Android App Walkabout allows users to sign up either with a basic email/password or through Google Auth which is persisited through Firebase Authenication.
User can add details about their favourite places to walk, entering a title, difficulty and terrain type. Personal entries can be edited or deleted through use of a swipe action. Full list of other users walks can be displayed through a toggle button, where unique entries are identified by users display image. 
App navigation is done through a nav drawer which allows user to add walks, see list of walk, view an about page and sign out.
Entries are persisted with Firebase database.
When a google user signs in their google display name, email and image are display back to the user within the Navdrawer. User can change their display image for the app and images are stored within Firebase storage.

### Personal Statement
Found this assignment very interesting and very challenging. I had hoped to implement adding images for each walk location and adding a maps feature but sadly time was against me. Jetpack compose also looked like a nice way to develop android apps which hopefully I will get to study more of in the future.
